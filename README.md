# About

arm-preprocessing is a lightweight Python library supporting several key steps involving data preparation, manipulation, and discretization for Association Rule Mining (ARM). The design of this framework has a minimalistic design outlook in mind and is intended to be fully extensible and allow easy integration with other related ARM libraries, e.g., NiaARM.

## Key features

### Dataset processing

- Loading various formats of datasets (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- Converting datasets in different formats
- Loading different types of datasets (numerical dataset, discrete dataset, time-series data, text)
- Dataset identification (which type of dataset)
- Dataset statistics

### Dataset manipulation

- Support for dealing with missing data in ARM datasets
- Data squashing algorithms Implementation
-

### Time-series dataset support operations

- Converting time attributes
-

### Association rule text mining

### Dataset visualization

### Other

-
